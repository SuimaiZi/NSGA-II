_**note**: this implementation of NSGA-II algorithm is in pure reference to the original published paper. This is not an effort to convert the originally implemented C code in Java. The original C code by the authors has not be referred to while writing this implementation._

_**Dependency: Java(>=1.8), JFreeChart(1.5.0), JCommon(1.0.24)**_

### Please Note:

This is **v2** of the algorithm implementation. This reference implementation has been updated to be:

* Much simpler than the previous version.
* More efficient than the previous version.
* Resolves an issue with the Binary Tournament Selection procedure.
* Provides a simple interactive console while running the algorithm.
* Updated dependencies.

The reference **v1** implemention can be found in the [here](https://github.com/onclave/NSGA-II/tree/master/v1). The _README_ of that implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/onclave/NSGA-II/blob/master/v1/README.md).

The _README_ document of **v2** is still incomplete and under progress. Code commenting of **v2** is also under progress and not all code is commented properly. This shall be done shortly. In the mean time, if you are unable to understand any part of the code, feel free to open an _issue_ about it and I shall try to resolve it.
